Lisbeth (Bette) Fischer, a seamstress for the demimonde of actresses and courtesans and the poor relation of Baron Hulot, has a secret: she is helping to support a poor but noble Polish sculptor. Baron Hulotâs daughter Hortense discovers the secret and helps herself to the handsome sculptor. Bette then unleashes an underhanded stratagem dictated by her implacably vengeful heart: using Baron Hulotâs insatiable lust as a lever, Bette organizes her courtesan connections to ruin him, both morally and financially. Scary and psychologically acute.</p>

Byron was a gentleman, a womanizer, a cad, and a liberator. He poured a lifetime of observations into this seventeen canto poem. Ostensibly about a Spanish boy sent abroad by his mother after an unfortunate love affair, it has the spontaneous gaiety of a man who is courteously maintaining the fiction that the readerâs experience of women, politics, poetry, and the world is as extensive as his own. Thus Byron transformed his greatest masterpieceâhis lifeâinto art.</p>

The form of this novel, about two Native American families, reenacts that of a traditional Chippewa Indian story cycleâfourteen stories told by seven characters, forming a collage that forces the reader to sift through and weigh voice against voice, truth against truth. The bookâs main storyâa long-standing love triangle among a husband and wife and the promiscuous Lulu Lamartineâis often upstaged by Erdrichâs antimythic portrayal of Native Americans cut off from their traditional land, culture, and gods.</p>

Aloof, unhappy, and tortured by his own âhyperconsciousness,â Dostoevskyâs narrator prefers to remain underground, away from normal life, because at least there he can be free. When he forces himself to dine with three schoolfellows, their carefree laughter and drinking sends him âinto a fury.â Afterward, he is seemingly moved by the plight of a young prostitute. But neither pity nor love is reÂ­ deeming in this story whose narrator asks: âWhich is betterâcheap happiness or exalted suffering?â Dostoevskyâs preference is clear.</p>

This vivid apocalyptic tale with dozens of finely drawn characters begins with the militaryâs mistaken release of a deadly superflu that wipes out almost everyone on earth. The few survivors, spread out across the barren United States, are visited in their dreams by a kindly old woman in Nebraska and a sinister man in the West. They begin making their way toward these separate camps for what will prove to be a last stand between the forces of good and evil.</p>

The happy peace that Prospero, a powerful magician and former Duke of Milan, and his daughter Miranda share on an enchanted island is broken when a group of Prosperoâs former enemies and friends is shipwrecked there. Through the services of his two servants, the base Caliban, to whom the island had originally belonged, and the sprite Ariel, Prospero exacts revenge upon his stranded enemies while engineering the marriage of his daughter to a young nobleman. Anticipating themes that would inform colonial and postcolonial literatureâ usurpation, bondage, rebellionâ Â­this was Shakespeareâs last play without a collaborator.</p>

Beautiful and high-spirited Janie Crawford wants love and adventure. But, as Hurston shows in her finest novel, living in an all-black town is no shield against the sexism that dictates her young life. Forced to marry one controlling old geezer, she deserts him only to end up with another. When she marries Tea Cake, Janie finally enjoys the essence of a true relationship. Her happiness is short-lived when disaster strikes, but it becomes the catalyst for ultimate self-discovery.</p>

M. Forster (1924). A handful of English people searching for the ârealâ India get far more than they bargained forâup to and including a terrifying transcendental experience in a very dark cave. Forsterâs novel of the Raj is infused with a generous, liberal humanism; the author writes like a man determined that Indians should populate a novel of India, and he succeeds in this beautifully imagined portrait of both colonizer and colonized.</p>

In this withering satire of eighteenth-century optimism, Candide wanders the world testing his tutor Panglossâs belief that we live in the âbest of all possible worlds.â When Candide loses his true love, gets flogged in the army, injured in an earthquake, and robbed in the New World, he finally muses, âIf this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others?â In response to lifeâs mysteries, he concludes, the best we can do is patiently cultivate our own gardens.</p>

Disowned by her family, confined in a brothel and raped, Clarissa pays a high price for her morality. Yet she accepts her fate with a moving acceptance in this landmark of English realistic fiction.</p>

This rollicking yet existential adventure with deep religious undertones begins with fatherly advice: pursue a stable career. But the wastrel son denies his father because he is tempted by the sea. This salty path gets young Robinson kidnapped by Moorish pirates, sold into slavery, and shipwrecked on a remote island filled with cannibals. Yet this island seems an Eden to Crusoe, whose ingenuity enables him to tame the land, conquer the natives, and save the life of an islander, whom he makes his servant and christens Man Friday, as he comes to recognize and accept Godâs will.</p>

Comic, ribald, and highly entertaining, Tom Jones reminds us just how rowdy the eighteenth century got before the nineteenth came and stopped the fun.</p>

Orwellâs reputation as an antiauthoritarian arises in large part from this novel set in a totalitarian future in which citizens are constantly reminded âBig Brother is watchingâ as they are spied upon by the Thought Police and one another. In this landscape, Winston Smith is a man in danger simply because his memory works. He understands that the Partyâs total control of its citizens is based on its ability to control its message and its citizensâ memories, and he is slowly drawn into a dangerous love affair and then an alliance, called the Brotherhood, of men and women united to fight Big Brother. Some of the vocabulary Orwell created for 1984ânewspeak, doublethink, Big Brotherâhave become part of todayâs vocabulary.</p>

Lemuel Gulliver, a shipâs doctor, embarks on four wondrous voyages from England to remote nations. Gulliver towers over six-inch Lilliputians and cowers under the giants in Brobdingnag. He witnesses a flying island and a country where horses are civilized and people are brutes. Fanciful and humorous, Swiftâs fictional travelogue is a colorfully veiled but bitter indictment of eighteenth-century politics and culture.</p>

The characters sometimes seem futile as they score drugs and scrounge for money and love, but the real story is the narratorâs fumbling process toward self-discovery.</p>

The novels, set a decade apart, reveal two dimensions of the troubled family, which includes three children.</p>

Martin Scorsese called his 1993 movie of this novel the most violent film he had madeâquite a statement from the director of Raging Bull. The innocence here is not in the setting of 1870s upper-crust New York, whose starch-stiff social code hides a viperâs nest of jealousies and conspiracy, but in hero Newland Archer, a newlywed socialite who fancies himself simply an observer of his class. His infatuation with a European divorcÃ©e leads to a most unsentimental education on his true position.</p>

<p><em>Appreciation of Rebecca Westâs The Fountain Overflows by Margot Livesey</em></p>
<p>I donât know why I waited so long to read The Fountain Overflows. There was a copy in the library of my Scottish school; after all, the novel sold 40,000 copies in 1956, the year it was published. Perhaps it was even in my fatherâs library, squeezed between, say, Aldous Huxleyâs Chrome Yellow and Evelyn Waughâs Decline and Fall, two novels I adored. The book was around but the truth is I didnât want to read it, in part because I associated it with Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, Westâs massive tome about preâWorld War II YugoÂ­ slavia, which I didnât want to read even more. I finally succumbed only a few years ago at the urging of a dear friend.</p>
<p>Some books, much lauded on publication, rapidly gather dust, but luckily for me The Fountain Overflows remains as lustrous and passionate as when West penned the last page. The novel tells the story of the Aubrey family living in Edwardian London. Mr. Aubrey is a charismatic and unreliable journalist; Mrs. Aubrey, a former pianist, is an awkward woman of immense moral intelligence. Around these two orbit the Aubrey children: the musical Mary and Rose, the awful Cordelia who wants to be musical, and the beloved Richard Quinn. The story is told by Rose.</p>
<p>One scene captures for me Westâs genius. A man comes to complain to Mrs. Aubrey about her husband having an affair with his wife. After she has done her best to cheer him up, Mrs. Aubrey takes refuge in Madame Bovary and, by the time her husband arrives home, is absorbed in the novel. Together they praise and criticize Flaubert. Only then does she recall what brought herto pick up the novel in the first place. âI am really very heartless,â she cried, rising to her feet. âBut art is so much more real than life. Some art is much more real than some life, I mean.â</p>
<p>And this is exactly how I feel about The Fountain Overflows; it is more real, and more pleasurable, than most life.</p>

Marloweâs incorruptibility and concentration on the case are challenged even more when the obsessively independent private eye falls in love, apparently for the first time, with a different rich and sexy woman. She proposes marriage, but he puts her off, claiming he feels âlike a pearl onion on a banana splitâ among her set.</p>

This lush, lyric, sensual, and surreal novel then follows two main interrelated plots that skate along the blurry lines between good and evil, love and betrayal, knowledge and ignorance. The first plot line details these menâs tangled lives and strange transformations in London and Bombay; the second reimagines the life of Mohammed so critically that Iranâs Ayatollah Khomeni issued a death sentence against Rushdie.</p>

Powellâs panoramic series of twelve freestanding novels, grouped in four âmovements,â charts the careers of four public-school friends from 1921 to 1971 against the backdrop of rapidly changing London. Built mosaic-like from many intimate, seemingly inconsequential encounters and scenes, the narrative moves with the pace, prismatic glitter, and cumulative force of a glacier, sweeping along sex, art, business, politics, and values in its wake. Devotees, who consider Powell to be Englandâs answer to Proust, praise the elegant style, intricate plotting, and above all the masterly characterizations, in a work that encompasses comedy, tragedy, and realism.</p>

Few twentieth-century literary works were as influential as Borgesâs first collection of surreal âfictions.â Showcasing his deeply serious, brilliantly playful fascination with language, literature, and metaphysics, these seventeen storiesâabout imaginary books and labyrinthine libraries, cosmic detectives and strange landsâask us to wonder about how we know what we know (or think we know) while helping light the fuse of postmodern pyrotechnics.</p>

Fearing that his empireâs vastness has made it âan endless, formless ruin,â Kublai Khan asks the traveler Marco Polo to describe it to him so he might understand and thereby control it. What Polo offers are accounts of surreal placesââhidden cities,â âtrading cities,â and âthin citiesâ (whose buildings have no walls, floors or ceilings)âinhabited by people whose actions seem inexplicable in this novel of ideas concerned with memory and time, language and community, and the landscapes of the physical world and the imagination.</p>

The story of star-crossed Veronese lovers, this early romantic tragedy painfully depicts the fatal course of young lovers ruined by circumstances beyond their control, belonging as they do to two families who hate each other for long forgotten reasons. The intense violence at the heart of the play is matched only by the intense passion of Romeo and Juliet, who pay the ultimate price for the brief, intense, and pure love they shared.</p>

In all of Greeneâs prolific career, he never surpassed the stark beauty of this tale of a priest who is virtuous despite himself. Set in Mexico during the revolution, when Catholicism was illegal, the novel follows the movements of a character known only as âthe whisky priestââhe drinks, he bilks the faithful, he has fathered a child. But as his world narrows and he must make life or death choices, his life becomes a complicated display of salvation.</p>

Starting with the real-life psychiatric treatment of poet and British officer Sigfried Sassoon for shellshock, Barker shows how the war ruined but failed to replace nineteenth-century norms of gender, class, sexuality, and honor.</p>

As in old pictures of Pittsburgh, a pall of industrial smoke seems to hang over Zolaâs grim, stirring novel about a miners strike. Zola uses his usual style of fine-grained graininess to describe the lives crushed (sometimes literally) by work, and the excessive poverty to which the minersâ families seem condemned. His is a collective portrait in which his main character, Etienne Lantier, gets engulfed by the hugeness and dangerousness of the mines (which bear the sinister nickname Le Voreux, or âthe voracious onesâ) and the eventual revolt against the mining company.</p>

Seeking renewal, Richard and Sara Everton leave San Francisco for a remote village in Mexico. There they hope to reopen Richardâs grandfatherâs old mine, to âpatch the present on to the past. To find out if there was still copper underground and how much the rest of it was true, the width of the sky, the depth of the stars, the air like new wine, the harsh noons and long, slow dusks.â In lovely, spare prose, this National Book Awardâwinning novel describes the Evertonsâ flowering relationships with the vividly drawn people of Ibarra and the deadly illness that hovers over their happiness.</p>

This novel might easily have become a victim of its own surpassing fame, which has removed all suspense from its central riddle: What is the relationship between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? Yet as our narrator plumbs Dr. Jekyllâs descent into drug-addled, alter-ego madness, we are riveted by Stevensonâs portrait of the good and evil that lurks in one manâs heart. âThis, too, was myself,â Jekyll says of Hyde. Somehow we suspect itâs us, too.</p>

This picaresque novel depicts the rise of Nazism in Germany and its terrible consequences through the adventures of Oskar Matzerath, âthe eternal three-year-oldâ who stunts his growth at three feet and uses his tin drum and piercing screams as weapons against a mad world. Chilling and absurd, teeming with black comedy and dark insights into the human soul, The Tin Drum is both an artistic triumph and an act of reclamation. As the Swedish Academy observed while presenting Grass with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999, the novel âcomes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: the victims, losers, and lies that people wanted to forget because they had once believed in them.â</p>

This grand experiment in narrative depicts six charactersâfrom nursery school to the brink of old ageâthrough a series of interior soliloquies. Stages in their lives are framed by bits of description of a day on a deserted beach; the bookâs finale, their reunion at a London restaurant, is a tour de force. âThe light of civilization is burnt out,â one character thinks while gazing at Londonâs night sky in this haunting, poetic meditation on timeâs passage.</p>

Ingratiating Uriah Heep, talented Mr. Micawber, devoted nurse Peggoty, and willing Barkis are some of the most memorable characters in the entire Dickens canon.</p>

Two French missionaries come to the vast and untamed deserts of New Mexico in 1851. Through a series of often symbolic stories about their shared and personal experiences over forty years, Cather depicts both vanished landscapes and timeless themes of faith, loneliness, and our relationships with one another and the natural world.</p>

A retelling of Cain and Abel set in Californiaâs Salinas Valley between the Civil War and World War I, this novel takes off when Adam Trask realizes that maybe he shouldnât have married the lovely yet soulless prostitute Cathy Ames: on their wedding night she betrays him with his brother. Still, they produce twin boys, but Cathy, driven by undeniable demons, forsakes the newborns for her old life. Adam tells his rivalrous sonsâCaleb, the bad penny, and sweet Aronâtheir mother is dead. But when Caleb learns the truth, the familyâs uneasy peace gives way to mayhem and a searing battle between good and evil as characters grapple with their destiny.</p>

On hellâs short bookshelf of great writing about alcohol, this novel is narrated by Sasha Jansen, a semi-writer at loose ends who is planning a permanent swan dive into the bottle. While Virginia Woolf thought women needed a room of their own for creative work, Jansen believes âa room is a place where you hide from the wolves outside.â Jansenâs fugue through 1930s Paris, while pursued by age, disapproving bartenders, and a stubborn gigolo, is a cafÃ© blues song: stylish and haunting.</p>

Like an existential sadist, Sophocles explores the tragic complexities of fate by hurling his characters into situations in which they are simultaneously guilty and innocent, forced to choose between right and right or wrong and wrongâor some painfully imprecise combination of the two. In Oedipus the King, Oedipus is desperate to escape his fateâthat he will murder his father and marry his motherâyet inexorably fulfills it with devastating effect. In Oedipus at Colonus, the blind, self-exiled ruler moves toward faith and goodness as his sons battle for his throne. In the third play, Antigone, his loving and upright daughter is forced to choose with climactic consequence between equally worthy goals as Sophocles depicts our struggles to explain a world we can scarcely comprehend.</p>

The celebrated miniaturistâs only long fiction, which was thirty years in the making, is a bitter satire depicting a 1931 ocean voyage from Mexico (Veracruz) to Germany (Bremen). Inspired by Sebastian Brantâs fifteenth-century allegory of the same title, it is a portrayal of marital, class, and ethnic conflicts among passengers aboard the ship Vera (âTruthâ). These include an ailing doctor, a drug-addicted âContessa,â various uprooted Americans, gypsy dancers, and twin malevolent children. Praised for its artistry, condemned for its vitriolic anti-German sentiment, Porterâs Odyssey remains a fascinating, infuriating novel.</p>

Filled with the tensions between rural America and its bustling urban future, and between propriety and ambition, Sister Carrie is a haunting portrait of a nationâs contradictory impulses.</p>

Beginning with his first trip at age ten, we watch him master the art of hunting, learning the ways of men and the woods. The ultimate prize is the legendary bear, Old Ben, a symbol of the untamed world âwhich the little puny humans swarmed and hacked at in a fury of abhorrence and fear.â When sixteen-year-old Ike gets Old Ben in his sights, history, maturity, and ecological consciousness collide in a powerful rite of passage.</p>

In her epic fusion of structural experiment and exhaustive realism, Lessing lays bare the splintered state of modern womanhood. In four separate notebooks, Anna Wulf records different aspects of her life: her consecutive and unfulfilling love affairs, her memories of Africa, her struggles with motherhood, and above all, her growing disenchantment with communism. Lessingâs novel foreshadowed the concerns of the womenâs movement, becoming a major feminist text.</p>

While liberal rebels roam the hills of Sicily, and rumors spread that Garibaldiâs army is poised for invasion, the old prince Don Fabrizio struggles to manage his vast and now threatened estates. âI belong to an unfortunate generation,â he says, âswung between the old world and the new, and I find myself ill at ease in both.â While charting what he sees as nineteenth-century Sicilyâs necessary movement toward science and liberal politics, Lampedusa uses the admirable prince to suggest the traditions and values lost in the process.</p>

Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him. For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenagerâa teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. And there he seeks the help of Rothâs alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, to help him make sense of it all.</p>
